/* ******************************************************************************
 *
 * Extend placeholder classes
 *
 * Sass let's us use @extend [selector] to highlight chunks of our file that all 
 * share css with the same selector. By using @extend, it gathers these all up
 * on output and places them in a single, shared selector, keeping filesize down.
 * The benefit over using a mixin is that the mixin results are only added to the
 * css file once with multiple selectors, instead of repeated for all the selectors.
 *
 * In this file, we can create "fake" selectors that won't parse on their own, but
 * give us a hook to extend further selectors down the chain.
